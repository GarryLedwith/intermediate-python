# Tuple is a collection datatype that is ordered and immutable.
# It can hold a collection of items, which can be of different data types.
# Tuples are defined using parentheses () instead of square brackets [] like lists.
# Tuples are often used to group related data together.
# Example of a tuple containing strings
mytuple1 = ('banana', 'apple', 'orange')
print(mytuple1[0])  # Accessing the first element ('banana')
